Boon Pin graduated from the National University of Singapore (NUS) with a BSc. (Hons) majoring in sociology and minoring in religious studies, where he studied on a NUS Undergraduate Merit Scholarship. He attributes the critical thinking with which he approaches problems to his having developed a strong grounding in sociology through his undergraduate education, which trained him to understand problems contextually and question ideas rigorously \u2014 to dig deep into the 'why' and 'for whom' of questions. Boon Pin believes that as long as one's eyes are kept on the 'why' before diving into the 'how,' there is meaningful impact to be made together, collectively and cumulatively \u2014 a little at a time, there can be better, brighter world to which to look forward.",
